# Dahab Dive Sites 🐠

This is my first assignment in the Front-End track at Route Academy.  
The task was to recreate a given design using **HTML only** (no CSS), matching the structure and layout of the original sample.

## 📝 Assignment Goals

- Use semantic HTML tags only (no CSS).
- Recreate the layout and structure of the provided design.
- Choose a custom topic and suitable content (I chose scuba diving sites in Dahab).
- Use proper image `alt` attributes.
- Ensure images maintain a consistent **aspect ratio** without using width or height manually.

## 📸 Theme

**Dahab Dive Sites** — A simple layout introducing famous diving spots in Dahab, Egypt.

## 🌈 Notes

- All colors were selected using [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co) for good visual harmony.
- Images were resized/cropped to maintain a consistent aspect ratio, with help from [this tool](https://bit.ly/3LufQkm).
